# -jobconnect-portal
A job search website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend and Node.js for backend, along with MySQL for data storage and user management.
JobConnect Portal is a web app-based Job Portal that enables Users to search, Post, and apply to Jobs. The program is developed with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and vanilla JavaScript, which provides an intuitive user experience to all users (job seekers and recruiters). The user will have the option to create accounts and log in to enjoy special services such as creating job adverts or submitting resumes in PDF. When logged in, employers will be able to add jobs with respective information that will be kept in the MySQL database and shown dynamically on the front page. Job seekers can be able to search and filter jobs based on the title of the job, the name of the company, tags or even location. The app establishes a connection between the frontend and backend based on the RESTful APIs, and offers improved flexibility and data stream in the app. Resumes are uploaded and then can be related to the account of user. The design is responsive, and the interface and navigation between the pages, including Jobs, post job, resume upload, and registration, are responsive to fit a user-friendly design of the platform.
